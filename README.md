In the early 2010s I was immersed in creating synth-based music,  
inspired by the techno sound of that era.  
This site began as a landing page for that project, but over time, 
It became a creative sandbox -  
especially for **experimenting with native SVG animations** and minimal web design.  
A snapshot of that creative era.
